Hi, I'm Benjamin Schober, Master's student at UAS St. Pölten for Digital Media Production, specializing on Sound.
Throughout my course of studies I've done a few projects, all touching different areas of Audio production. DIY-Loudspeaker projects, interactive applications with MAX, 3D-audio production in Dolby Atmos and HOA.
In my master's thesis, I'm comparing plausibility of virtual sound sources for auditory augmented reality between different headphone types.

My Github page mainly functions as a private storage for all my project files and research data, as well as sharing the occasional snippet or asset that might be of interest to others.

If you have any questions or just wanna say Hi, feel free to hit me up via mp221512@fhstp.ac.at.

Cheers!
